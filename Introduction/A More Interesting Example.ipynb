Asife from obvious simplifications like  $\\boldsymbol{x - x = 0}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}}$, most simplifications are not performed automatically. This is because we might prefer the factored form $\\boldsymbol{x(x + 2y)}$, or we might prefer the expanded form $\\boldsymbol{x^{2} + 2xy}$. Both forms are useful in different circumstances.
