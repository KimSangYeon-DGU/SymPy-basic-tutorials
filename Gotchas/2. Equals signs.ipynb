Here, '(x + 1)^2' and 'x^2 + 2x + 1' are not the same symbolically. One is the power of an addition of two terms, and the other is the addition of three terms.\n",

    "It turns out that when using SymPy as a library, having '==' test for exact structural equality is far more useful than having it represent symbolic equality, or having it test for mathematical equality. However, as a new user, you will probably care more about the latter two. We have already seen an alternative to representing equalities symbolically, Eq. To test if two things are equal, it is best to recall the basic fact that if 'a = b', then 'a - b = 0'. Thus, the best way to check if 'a = b'  is to take 'a - b' and simplify it, and see if it goes to 0. We will learn later that the function to do this is caled 'simplify'. This method is not infalliable -- infact, it can be theoretically proven that it is impossible to determine if two symbolic expressions are identically equal in general -- but for most common expressions, it works quite well."
