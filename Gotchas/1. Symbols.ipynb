This can be complicated if several lines created 'expr'. One advantage of using a symbolic computation system like SymPy is that we can build a symbolic representation for 'expr', and then substitute 'x' with values. The correct way to do this in SymPy is to use 'subs', which will be discussed in more detail later."
